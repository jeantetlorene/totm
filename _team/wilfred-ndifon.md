Professor Wilfred Ndifon is an Associate Research Fellow at AIMS. His research focuses on biomathematics and mathematical immunology, developing quantitative approaches to understand complex biological systems, particularly the immune system and its response to infections.

As a leader in mathematical biology, Prof. Ndifon has made significant contributions to our understanding of immune system dynamics, developing mathematical models that help explain and predict immune responses to pathogens and vaccines, with implications for public health and medical interventions.

Through his role as an Associate Research Fellow and as a supervisor to postgraduate students in biomathematics, he fosters interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mathematics and biology, addressing complex biological questions through innovative mathematical approaches and computational methods.
